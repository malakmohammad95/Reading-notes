    <p> في ظل انتشار فيروس كورونا وعدم مقدرة المتقدمين للحضور شخصيًا ولأن بعضًا منهم من خارج الأردن (ألمانيا، أمريكا، السعودية، تركيا، كندا) كانت جزءًا من مقابلاتنا مع الفوج الثاني أونلاين عن طريق منصة Zoom.
        سعدنا بلقائكم عن بعد وبكم مستمرون 🥰

    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS is used to customize the style of the web site) and scripting languages such as JavaScript (JavaScript is used to make a dynamic web site)

    </p>

<div class="week week1"><b>JavaScript</b>
<p>JavaScript is mainly a client-side scripting or programming language that is used to implement dynamic features for the web, it can be run on most browsers and especially the mainstream browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox. Internet Explorer and Safari. To write and run JavaScript code on Google Chrome you can open the console by right-clicking the page then choosing inspect or by opening the Console tab. You can also use the following shortcuts if you are on windows Ctrl + Shift + i or F12 and on macOS you can use Option + Command + i or F12.</p>

<div class="week week4"><b>Css</b>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages by describing how HTML elements are displayed.

    CSS can modify HTML elements in many way such as changing the color, size, font, margins, paddings and much more, there are multiple ways of using CSS, each has it is own pros and cons but the best way to use CSS is by creating an external file for it then link it with the HTML.</p>
